# Amazon-Webscraper

This is a webscraper that I created for fun to gather information from an Amazon product that I wanted to purchase. Once I scraped the information, I was able to create a function that emails me data on the product, so that when a price change occurs, I'm able to buy the product.


This program can be used by first having access to Jupyter Notebook. Once you have access to the notebook, you must download the file or copy the contents and import them into a project in Jupyter Notebook.
